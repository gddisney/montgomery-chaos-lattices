## Configuration

Montgomery Chaos Lattices allows customization through various parameters:

- **Key Size (`bits`)**: Determines the strength of the chaos key. Must be a multiple of 64 and at least 64 bits.
- **Small Prime Limit**: Used during key generation to sieve small primes. Default is set to 10,000.
- **Prime Bits**: Number of bits for prime generation in lattice points. Default is 256 bits.
- **Miller-Rabin Rounds**: Number of rounds for primality testing. Default is 40 for enhanced security.
- **Lattice Dimensions and Size**: Configurable dimensions and size of the lattice structure, influencing the complexity and security of the cipher.

These parameters can be adjusted by modifying the source code or through additional configuration files if implemented in future updates.

## Examples

### 1. Generating a 256-bit Chaos Key

```bash
montgomery-chaos-lattices gen 256 chaos_key.pem
```

**Output:**

```
Chaos key successfully saved to chaos_key.pem
```

### 2. Verifying the Generated Chaos Key

```bash
montgomery-chaos-lattices verify 256 chaos_key.pem
```

**Output:**

```
Chaos key verification successful. HMAC is valid.
```

### 3. Encrypting a Plaintext File

Assume you have a plaintext file named `secret.txt`.

```bash
montgomery-chaos-lattices encrypt 256 chaos_key.pem secret.txt secret_encrypted.pem
```

**Output:**

```
Encryption successful. Ciphertext saved to secret_encrypted.pem
```

### 4. Decrypting the Ciphertext File

```bash
montgomery-chaos-lattices decrypt 256 chaos_key.pem secret_encrypted.pem secret_decrypted.txt
```

**Output:**

```
Decryption successful. Plaintext saved to secret_decrypted.txt
```

After decryption, `secret_decrypted.txt` should match the original `secret.txt`.

## Security Considerations

While **Montgomery Chaos Lattices** is designed with strong cryptographic principles, consider the following to maintain security:

- **Montgomery Ladder Security**: The use of Montgomery ladders in lattice binding provides resistance against side-channel attacks by ensuring uniform execution paths. This technique is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality of the lattice structures.
  
- **Chaos-Based Randomness**: Chaotic sequences are employed to generate high-entropy pseudorandom numbers, enhancing the diffusion properties of the cipher. Ensure that the chaotic algorithms used are robust and free from predictable patterns.
  
- **Key Management**: Protect chaos keys (`chaos_key.pem`) securely. Compromise of the key can lead to decryption of sensitive data.
  
- **Randomness Source**: Ensure the underlying system's random number generator (used by `OsRng`) is secure and properly seeded to prevent predictability in key and sequence generation.
  
- **S-Box Integrity**: The bijective nature of the S-Box and its inverse must be maintained to ensure correct encryption and decryption. Any alteration can compromise the cipher's functionality.
  
- **Algorithm Review**: As a custom cipher, it hasn't undergone extensive peer review. Use it judiciously and consider professional audits for critical applications.
  
- **Updates**: Stay updated with the latest releases to benefit from security patches and improvements.
